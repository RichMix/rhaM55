# Figure 3.1: Significant file-system directories in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

The / directory is the root directory at the top of the file-system hierarchy. 
The / character is also used as a directory separator in file names. 
For example, if etc is a subdirectory of the / directory, then refer to that directory as /etc. 
Likewise, if the /etc directory contains a file that is named issue, then refer to that file as /etc/issue.
Subdirectories of / are used for standardized purposes to organize files by type and purpose to make it easier to find files.
For example, in the root directory, the /boot subdirectory is used for storing files to boot the system.

# Note
The following terms help to describe file-system directory contents:

Static content remains unchanged until explicitly edited or reconfigured.
Dynamic or variable content might be modified or appended by active processes.
Persistent content remains after a reboot, such as configuration settings.
Runtime content from a process or from the system is deleted on reboot.
The following table lists some of the significant directories on the system by name and purpose.

Table 3.1. Significant Red Hat Enterprise Linux Directories

Location	Purpose
/boot	Files to start the boot process.
/dev	Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.
/etc	System-specific configuration files.
/home	Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.
/root	Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.
/run	Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the /var/run and /var/lock directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
/tmp	A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The /var/tmp directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.
/usr	Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the /usr directory include the following commands:
/usr/bin: User commands

/usr/sbin: System administration commands

/usr/local: Locally customized software

/var	System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under /var.

# Important
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, four older directories in / have identical contents to their counterparts in /usr:

/bin and /usr/bin

/sbin and /usr/sbin

/lib and /usr/lib

/lib64 and /usr/lib64
