Like the Command Prompt and PowerShell in Windows OS, Linux has different types of shells available, each with its own features and characteristics.

Multiple shells are installed in different Linux distributions. To see which shell you are using, type the following command:

Current Shell
user@ubuntu:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
You can also list down the available shells in your Linux OS. The file /etc/shells contains all the installed shells on a Linux system. You can list down the available shells in your Linux OS by typing cat /etc/shells in the terminal:

Available Shells
user@ubuntu:~$ cat /etc/shells
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/usr/bin/screen
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
To switch between these shells, you can type the shell name that is present on your OS, and it will open for you, as can be seen below:

Switch Shell
user@ubuntu:~$ zsh
user@ubuntu ~ $
If you want to permanently change your default shell, you can use the command: chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh. This will make this shell as the default shell for your terminal.

There are many types of Linux shells. We will discuss a few of them and their features.

Bourne Again Shell
Bourne Again Shell (Bash) is the default shell for most Linux distributions. When you open the terminal, bash is present for you to enter commands. Before bash, some shells like sh, ksh, and csh had different capabilities. Bash came as an enhanced replacement for these shells, borrowing capabilities from all of them. This means that it has many of the features of these old shells and some of its unique abilities. Some of the key features provided by bash are listed below:

Bash is a widely used shell with scripting capabilities.
It offers a tab completion feature, which means if you are in the middle of completing a command, you can press the tab key on your keyboard. It will automatically complete the command based on a possible match or give you multiple suggestions for completing it.
Bash keeps a history file and logs all of your commands. You can use the up and down arrow keys to use the previous commands without typing them again. You can also type history to display all your previous commands.
Friendly Interactive Shell
Friendly Interactive Shell (Fish) is also not default in most Linux distributions. As its name suggests, it focuses more on user-friendliness than other shells. Some of the key features provided by fish are listed below:

It offers a very simple syntax, which is feasible for beginner users.
Unlike bash, it has auto spell correction for the commands you write.
You can customize the command prompt with some cool themes using fish.
The syntax highlighting feature of fish colors different parts of a command based on their roles, which can improve the readability of commands. It also helps us to spot errors with their unique colors.
Fish also provides scripting, tab completion, and command history functionality like the shells mentioned in this task.
Z Shell
Z Shell (Zsh) is not installed by default in most Linux distributions. It is considered a modern shell that combines the functionalities of some previous shells.
Some of the key features provided by zsh are listed below:

Zsh provides advanced tab completion and is also capable of writing scripts.
Just like fish, it also provides auto spell correction for the commands.
It offers extensive customization that may make it slower than other shells.
It also provides tab completion, command history functionality, and several other features.
